### 4.2. System Architecture

#### 4.2.1. MVC Models for Web Development

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture is a popular design pattern used in the development of software applications. In the context of a movie rental app, the MVC architecture provides a structured and organized approach to manage the different components of the application.

- The Model component of the movie rental app represents the data and the business logic. It encapsulates entities such as movies, users, rentals, and other related data. The Model component includes the data access layer, which interacts with the underlying database or data storage system to perform operations like retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting data. The Model also handles business logic operations, such as validating user inputs, managing rental transactions, integrating with external APIs for fetching movie information, and enforcing data integrity.

- The View component in the movie rental app is responsible for presenting the user interface to the users. It encompasses all the visual elements and user experience components of the application. The View component includes screens, forms, buttons, and other user interface elements that allow users to browse movies, search for movies based on different criteria, view detailed movie information, manage their rental queue, and interact with the application. The View component is designed to be visually appealing, intuitive, and responsive to enhance the overall user experience.

- The Controller component acts as the intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives user input from the View, processes it, and interacts with the Model to fetch or update the data accordingly. The Controller component handles tasks such as processing user requests, managing user authentication and authorization, managing rental transactions, coordinating the flow of data between the Model and the View, and triggering appropriate actions based on user interactions. It ensures that the user input is validated and appropriately acted upon, orchestrating the overall functionality and behavior of the movie rental app.

By adopting the MVC architecture, the movie rental app achieves modularity, code reusability, and easier maintenance. The separation of concerns enables developers to work independently on different components, allowing for better collaboration and development efficiency. Changes in one component can be made without affecting the others, making it easier to test, debug, and enhance specific parts of the application. Moreover, the MVC architecture promotes scalability and extensibility, as new features or modifications can be incorporated without disrupting the existing functionality, facilitating the continuous evolution of the movie rental app to meet the changing needs of its users.

### 4.3. Components Design

#### 4.3.1. Users Interface:

- Users are able to access:
  - Home Page
  - Feature Movies Page
  - Movie Pages
  - TV Shows Page
  - Show Pages
  - Profile Pages
  - Login/Register Pages
  - Search Page

#### 4.3.2. Authentication Interface:

The authentication interface and features of SmashBruh are as follows:

- Oauth2 and cookie based authentication:
  - In order to streamline the registration process even further, SmashBruh has also implements the Open Authorization 2.0 protocol(Oauth2).
  - SmashBruh Oauth2 implements support registering using other well known platform such as Google, GitHUb and Facebook, providing a near instant registering experience.
  - To further increase security, SmashBruh also implements a variant cookies based authentication.
  - The token is hashed and saved to the database to prevent cookie forging, the token is hashed and set using the bcrypt and jwt library.

### 4.4. Structure and Relationships

- User:

  - Description:
    - In our website, a user can rent, rate and like as many movies or TV shows as they like, so we have built our database which revolve around such requirements. A user document is linked with 3 other documents, which are User's favorite, rental and ratings.
  - Relationship:
    - A user can have many rentals (one-to-many relationship)
    - A user can like many rentals (one-to-many relationship)
    - A user can rate many rentals (one-to-many relationship)

- Movie/Show:

  - Description:
    - Since there are more than thousands of movies and TV shows current, in order to accurately and realistically access the information, we have opted to use an online movie and show database to fetch information. This means that there are no documents to store all of the movies and shows. Instead, we only fetch what we need, and store them.
  - Relationship:
    - A movie/show can be associated with one user, user rating, user order and user favorite (one-to-one relationship)

- History:
  - Description:
    - When a user search on the web page, a copy of the search string is saved to the database to enhance the user's experience.
  - Relationship:
    - A user can have many searched strings, and a searched string can belong to many users (many-to-many relationship)

### 5.2. Development Environment and Technology Stack

The development of SmashBruh Movie Renting Website requires a robust and efficient development environment to ensure the smooth creation and deployment of the platform. Here's an overview of the key components of the development environment:

- Programming Languages: JavaScript takes center stage in the development process of the SmashBruh movie renting website. As a dynamic and versatile programming language, JavaScript empowers the website with interactivity and functionality. It enables features like seamless search functionality, dynamic recommendations, interactive elements, and smooth navigation. JavaScript's integration with backend APIs ensures efficient data retrieval and real-time updates.
- Frameworks and Libraries:
  We decided to use a combination of libraries and database to assist us in implementing the app. The combination or MERN stack, consists of Node.js - a premier JavaScript web server, Express.js - a Node.js web framework, React - a client-side JavaScript framework and MongoDB - a document database. The middle or application tier of our system is built using Express and Node. Express.js serves as the server-side web framework, while Node.js acts as the robust and widely adopted JavaScript server platform. Together, these technologies form a powerful foundation for developing and delivering web applications. Express provides a streamlined and efficient framework for handling web requests and managing routes, while Node enables the execution of server-side JavaScript code, allowing for scalable and high-performance server applications.
- Database Management System:
  MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database management system, serves as the foundation for storing and managing data in the SmashBruh movie renting website. MongoDB offers a flexible and scalable approach to data storage, making it ideal for handling movie information, user profiles, rental history, and other pertinent data.
- Version Control System:
  With Git and GitLab, SmashBruh benefits from features like branch management, version control, and the ability to roll back changes if needed. This combination ensures that the development team can work concurrently, seamlessly integrate new features, resolve conflicts, and track the evolution of the codebase.
- Development Tools and Integrated Development Environment (IDE): With its intuitive interface and customizable settings, developers working on SmashBruh can personalize their coding environment according to their preferences. VS Code provides essential tools such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and linting, ensuring clean and error-free code. The built-in debugger enables efficient troubleshooting and debugging, helping to identify and fix issues quickly.
- Cloud Services: Leveraging cloud services can provide scalability, flexibility, and reliability to the website. We were able to achieve by using Vercel - a serverless platform for static and hybrid applications.
- Security Measures: Implementing robust security measures is vital to safeguard user data and protect against potential threats. This includes secure coding practices, user verification and authentication mechanisms, and also adherence to industry-standard security protocols.
- Continuous Integration and Deployment: With the help of GitLab, our implementation of CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline ensures integration of code changes, automated testing, and efficient deployment to staging and production environments.

By establishing a comprehensive development environment encompassing these components, SmashBruh can ensure efficient development processes, high-quality code, and a scalable platform that meets the needs and expectations of clients

### 5.3. CI/CD Testing, Docker and Deployment

The CI/CD pipeline automates the testing, building, and deployment of the application, ensuring efficient and reliable software delivery. The pipeline described in this document utilizes GitLab CI/CD and Docker for containerization.
The CI/CD pipeline consists of three stages: test, build and deploy. Information about each stage in detail:

1. Test Stage:

- Environment: The test stage uses the node:16 Docker image as the execution environment.
- Actions:
  - The pipeline changes the directory to views/React, removes existing node-modules and package-lock.json files, and installs dependencies using npm install.
  - Finally, it runs the tests using the npm test command.

2. Build Stage:

- Environment: The build stage utilizes the docker image and the docker:dind service, allowing Docker commands within the job. This stage involves two actions: constructing the server application image and creating the client application image.
- Actions:
  - For the build-server-image job:
    - The pipeline changes the directory to the server
    - It performs a Docker login to the specified registry using the provided credentials.
    - The server image is built using docker build, tagged with the specified names and tags, and pushed to the registry.
  - For the build-client-image job:
    - The pipeline changes the directory to views/React.
    - It performs a Docker login to the specified registry using the provided credentials.
    - The client image is built using docker build, tagged, and pushed to the registry.

3. Deploy Stage:

- The deploy stage follows the build stage and is responsible for deploying the application to the Vercel app.
- Deploy Stage Configuration:
  - Environment: The deploy stage utilizes the Vercel app integration, which requires setting up appropriate environment variables in the Vercel app.
  - Actions: When a new commit is pushed to GitLab, the pipeline initiates the deployment process by interacting with the Vercel app.
- Deploying to Vercel:
  - The pipeline integrates with the Vercel app, which allows for easy and automated deployment of the Node.js application.

In addition to the existing CI/CD pipeline stages, there is a specific section dedicated to deploying the backend of the application to the Render app. Due to limitations in the free tier of the Render app, automated deployment of the latest backend commit is not possible. Therefore, the deployment process for the backend needs to be done manually by deploying the most recent commit.

## 7. Conclusion

### 7.1. Summary of Project

In conclusion, our project aims to assist people in renting movies/shows and keeping track of their favourite movies/shows. Our web application is not a rental platform but it can acts as a middleware from clients to one if implemented correctly. With the The Movie Database as our main API, we can provide you information about every movies and TV shows that you like.

### 7.2. Future Work

- Despite facing time constraints and limited experience working on a large-scale team project, we encountered challenges in meeting deadlines and fully achieving our initial ideas and objectives. However, it is important to acknowledge the significant progress we have made and the invaluable lessons we have learned in the realms of web development and collaborative teamwork. Drawing from these experiences, we can identify future objectives aimed at refining and optimizing the app

- Parental Control System

  - With our vast database of movies and shows, it becomes necessary to address the potential exposure to explicit and graphic content. This concern is particularly crucial when our platform caters to young audiences, as it can lead to harmful interpretations and misuse of media. To mitigate these risks, we prioritize the implementation of a robust parental control system. The parental control system allows registered users to act as parents or guardians and exercise control over the content accessible to their children. By enabling this feature, explicit and inappropriate content can be effectively filtered out. This ensures that young users are protected from encountering material that is not suitable for their age group or could have a negative impact.

- Further Admin's Interface

  - Despite implementing an admin checking function and establishing a conducive work environment within the database for administrators, we currently lack dedicated admin interfaces for them to efficiently operate and moderate the system. To address this limitation, it is crucial to develop a comprehensive admin interface that offers an extensive range of functionalities. The interface should provide an overview of user information and rental details, enabling administrators to gain insights and perform necessary actions. Examples of these actions include the ability to ban or un-ban users, disable specific movies from being rented or viewed, and execute other administrative tasks. By providing a robust and user-friendly admin interface, we empower administrators with the tools they need to effectively carry out their responsibilities and streamline their workflow.

- Interactive Movie Discussion

  - Introduce a feature where users can engage in discussions, comment on movies, and participate in forums or live chats with other movie enthusiasts.
